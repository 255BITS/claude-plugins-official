# Game Content Rubric (Template)

Use this rubric to steer iterative “make it better” loops.

You can copy/paste this into your goal prompt, or keep it here as a stable contract.

## Dimensions (score mentally 1–5)

### 1) Fun / Delight
- Items create surprising choices
- Items encourage experimentation
- Effects feel satisfying (even on paper)

### 2) Variety / Coverage
- New items fill missing niches (roles, playstyles)
- Not everything is “+damage”
- There are meaningful tradeoffs

### 3) Balance / Power Curve
- No obvious outliers in a tier
- No strictly-dominant options
- Builds don’t collapse into one optimal line

### 4) Clarity / Learnability
- Names + descriptions match behavior
- Tags make sense and help players reason
- No “gotcha” effects without signaling

### 5) Synergy / Counterplay
- Some items synergize (combo potential)
- Strong effects have counters
- Interactions avoid infinite loops / degenerate strategies

## Loop guidance

Per iteration, prefer doing ONE of:

- Add 1–3 items that fill specific gaps
- Rebalance 3–8 items (reduce outliers)
- Add 1–5 interactions (synergy/counters)
- Improve clarity (rewrite descriptions + tags, keep ids stable)

## Anti-patterns

- “Everything gets stronger” (power creep)
- “Delete complexity” (removing interesting edges)
- “Random effects” (novelty without identity)
- “Id churn” (renaming ids constantly breaks downstream systems)
